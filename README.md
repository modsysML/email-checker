# email checker
As a user I should be able to use your plugin from the google chrome plugin store (we'll work on deployment later) - I want the ability to do the same as ugly email, once installed I should only work with indexDB to store data regarding emails (for security) but tell what email is being tracked. 

Here is a link to ugly email for context, feel free to play around with it; https://uglyemail.com/?ref=producthunt

It should accomplish the following: 

1. scans through your inbox and looks for emails containing tracking pixels. Tracked emails are labeled with an eyeball(Ugly Email Icon) icon, and the tracking pixel is blocked.

2. All of the Ugly Email data is stored on your browser's IndexDB storage locally. We do not track, transfer, or store any of your information.

This will allow users to know what emails are being watched and which ones aren't while preserving user privacy. Here is a github for inspo - https://github.com/OneClickLab/ugly-email-extension. 



### Setting up dev env
At this point you should've setup your virtual env

**Installation**
